Through its annual OHNY Weekend, Open House New York celebrates the best examples of design and planning throughout the five boroughs, from historic to contemporary, and helps foster a more informed conversation about how architecture and urban design sustain New York as a vibrant place to live, work, and learn.  This year for the first time OHNY invites you inside the studios and offices of some of the city's leading architects and designers. Visit the spaces where architects work, see new projects and meet the individuals who are designing the future of New York. BC—OA is honored to be included! Stop by Saturday 10/13 from 12-4pm More info [HERE](https://ohny.org/)
