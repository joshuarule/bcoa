BC—OA's first commission was the gut renovation of a Soho Loft on Crosby Street in 2010. Now 10 years later, we are beginning construction on the third loft in this building. See [Crosby Loft 1](https://bc-oa.com/projects/crosby-loft-1/) and [Crosby Loft II](https://bc-oa.com/projects/crosby-loft-2/) for the first two projects, as well as [Crosby Lobby](https://bc-oa.com/projects/crosby-lobby/) for the lobby renovation in the same building. Crosby Loft III coming your way soon!
