Created while working at Smith-Miller + Hawkinson Architects, 405 West 53rd Street, aka The Dillon, achieves an interlocking puzzle of urban living. The south-facing animated, folding glass curtain wall of this 87 Unit apartment building in Hell’s Kitchen participates in the revitalization of the area. A key feature in all units has been coined the “parallel projected window”, which allows the city to subtly enter the unit’s space. The diversity of dwelling type, ranging from duplex floor-throughs to triplex maisonette units with garage parking and private entrances, to familiar simplex units, offers a rare range of options for both buyer and seller. Bronwyn Breitner, principal of BC—OA, was a designer on this job from schematic design through construction when employed with SM+H.
