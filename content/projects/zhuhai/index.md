This convention and exhibition complex are part of the key elements of development for the wider Shizimen Business District in Zhuhai, China. The concept was driven by the “City of
Romance” label for the city of Zuhai, together with the connection of the
site to the water. A series of organic interconnected buildings
join together to form vibrant multi-leveled urban spaces. The
necessity for a very large orthogonal exhibition space is in sharp contrast
to the sinuous forms of the master plan, yet the design of the Exhibition
center acts as the backdrop to the seamless
ribbon convention center which wraps around enclosed and
open spaces throughout the development and water’s edge.
The Exhibition Center accommodates approximately 500,000
sq ft of interior sky lit exhibition space supported by ancillary
exterior gardens and back of house support
spaces.

Luigi Ciaccia was Senior Designer on the exhibition center
through the Design Development phase of the project. This
role required the coordination of the exhibition facility with
the master plan, while leading a team of 4 on the detailed
design development, exterior envelope and interior planning
of the project.
