BC—OA's first project was a Soho Loft renovation - [Crosby I](https://bc-oa.com/projects/crosby-loft-1/) - , which was published in Dwell and featured in Dwell Home Tours, and has led to many other loft renovations in Soho and Tribeca. The loft conversion to residential is a particular challenge, often times with odd proportions and limited access to daylight. Exposing the "old" industrial finishes - exposed brick, timber beams and columns, tin ceilings and cast-iron columns - and inserting the "new" is a challenge addressed differently by each client, and each project is made unique by the collaborative decisions on embracing the particularities of each loft.
