The site for this vacation residence is a sloped and densely wooded lot on Jungle Lake in Wisconsin. A small gable roofed existing cabin with an important nostalgic value to the client became the design generator for the expansion of that structure, plus the addition of a new house and garage, thus creating a family complex that can be selectively activated in full for large family gatherings, or in parts for individual visits. Both primary structures, therefor, respond to the form of the existing cabin on site by creating two unequal gabled roof lines. The taller of the two bars faces the lake, allowing sweeping views from a lofted second floor. A traditional rustic cabin form is made modern with a standing seam metal roof, the elimination of a traditional roof gutter and expanses of the exterior that are "carved away" to reveal a modern glass and metal structure behind. Both the renovated existing cabin and the new structure consist of two shifted bars that house dual living / kitchen / dining while framing an outdoor courtyard accessible from each structure. Full height sliding glass doors maximize views and open up to the outdoors, blurring the division between the semi-public outdoors and private interiors.
